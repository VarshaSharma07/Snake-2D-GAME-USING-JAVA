# Snake-2D-GAME-USING-JAVA:

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake and guides it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game screen and its own body. In this implementation, the game is built using Java and the graphical user interface (GUI) is created using the Java Swing library.

When the game starts, a snake is initially placed on the game screen, and the player can control its movements using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The objective is to maneuver the snake to eat the food that appears on the screen, which causes the snake's body to grow longer. The player earns points for each piece of food consumed.

As the game progresses, the snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the player's input. If the snake collides with the boundaries of the game screen or with its own body, the game ends. The final score achieved by the player is displayed on the screen.
